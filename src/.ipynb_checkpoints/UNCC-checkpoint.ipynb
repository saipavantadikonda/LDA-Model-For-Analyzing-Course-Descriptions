      "An overview of the fundamental concepts of design computation through explorations with methods such as parametric software and scripting. Students study these methods in the context of emerging areas of architectural technology research such as Building Information Modeling (BIM), digital fabrication, building performance optimization, and generative design, among others.\n",
      "Undertakes a historical survey of the dominant theoretical rubrics designers have used to integrate scientific concepts into architectural research since the Enlightenment. The course is divided into two parts. The first half exposes students to the range of conceptual strategies and techniques architects have used to translate scientific concepts into architectural form, from direct experimentation of structural principles to analogical and metaphorical models of procedural design strategies. The second half requires students to develop a working thesis statement of their independent research that places their work within one of the historical traditions reviewed in class.\n",
      "This introductory graduate course in architecture is intended for students newly admitted to the School of Architecture’s 3+ year professional program. This five-week, intensive studio-based course includes an introduction to freehand drawing, 2-D composition, 3-D modeling, and visual theory. In addition, the course offers an introduction to a variety of related topics (history, urbanism, structure, lighting, materials, etc.) that serve as critical departure points for understanding and making architectural and urban projects.\n",
      "An introductory architectural design studio that focuses on the development of site, space, and design process issues, as well as the continued acquisition and practice of a variety of technical and graphic skills. Exploration into the creative and appropriate use of a variety of media is addressed.\n",
      "Focuses on the study of topical areas of technology in architecture. Provide an in-depth extension of the five required technology courses. The course may be selected from a number of designated technology courses that examine specific issues contributing to architecture as a process of investigation, innovation, analysis and/or research.\n",

      "This seminar class concentrates on fundamental concepts, issues, and working knowledge specific to design in architecture. It is intended to complement the design problems encountered in ARCH 6100 (studio) and to serve as a critical platform to raise issues that are not always evident in studio making alone. Primary topics addressed include order, form and space, site, type, and architectural meaning.\n",
      "A fundamental visual and architectural skills course that includes lessons in: visual composition, 2D design and communication, 3D physical models, graphic and photographic image manipulation, and craft in design. Also includes readings and criticism, which address the artistic and architectural correlation of these skills.\n",
      "Introduces students to architectural drafting (2D) and modeling (3D) using digital tools and processes. The expected outcome of this course is a student who is skillful, adaptable, and critical in the use of digital media.\n",
      "Enables directed individual study and in-depth analysis of a special area related to the interests of the student and the expertise of the advising faculty member. May count towards completion of Concentration requirements if appropriate.\n",
      "Focuses on issues relevant to current architectural practice and/or exploration of architectural theory. Students choose from among several sections of this studio, each of which addresses a different set of issues. The issues addressed as well as the pedagogical approach of these studios are defined by the faculty teaching them. All students must take a minimum of one Topical Design Studio within their area of Concentration.\n",
      "Focuses on a site-specific project emphasizing technological and systemic issues that lead toward a comprehensive building design.\n",

      "Offers support and structure for students undertaking their individualized project in the MArch program. Focuses upon an individually defined architectural design project, or upon an individually defined research project (see Requisite and Capstone Experiences for more details). The faculty member teaching the course coordinates the activities of the students and their advisory committees.\n",
      "Focuses on examination of analytic and synthetic models including information processing, programming, and implementation activities used to structure the architect’s design process, conjectural models, and methods specific to the architect’s creative skills.\n",
      "Provides structure for the formation and exploration of the ideas and issues relevant to the project in the MArch program. This project is to be undertaken individually by students in their final year of study. This course results in the documentation of relevant research in preparation for the execution of the project, which is carried out in ARCH 7104.\n",
      "An introduction to the important issues that involve design within the fields of computing and architecture. Design has become increasingly important to computer scientists and at the same time computation has become important to designers. This course serves as a survey of these overlapping interests.\n",
      "The Studio/Lab sequence situates students with varying backgrounds in an educational environment that allows them to develop and test innovative computational design tools, applications and settings. Each semester is jointly taught by faculty from the School of Architecture and the College of Computing and Informatics, and is organized around a topic chosen by the participating faculty. Each focused topic requires expertise both in spatial design and computational design, and results in prototypes and evaluation.\n",

      "The Thesis is the culmination of the student’s work in the Dual Degree Program. It allows students to pursue focused research based upon their previous experiences and coursework. The intent is to demonstrate an understanding of an ongoing discourse, to form a clear hypothesis and to develop research methods suitable to implement and test the hypothesis.\n",
      "An optional opportunity for research in which MArch II students may engage. Allows graduate students to engage research activities to support their growing knowledge of architecture and architectural discourse. Informs and motivates possible interests that the students might pursue in their final year of study.\n"
