When sequence data is produced in a highly parallel fashion across a large fraction of a genome it is the basis of genomics. For historical reasons, the sample put on a sequencer is called a library, and the art of genomics lies in library construction. The experimental design and the technical details of library construction significantly affects the analyses that are appropriate and the conclusions that can be made. Lectures cover the design of experiments, how to critically read the literature to select an appropriate protocol for a variety of experimental purposes, and follow it to transform a sample into high quality sequence data. Quality control and library validation methods are explained. Topics include selecting applications tuned to the experiment design to ensure proper data analysis and interpretation.
