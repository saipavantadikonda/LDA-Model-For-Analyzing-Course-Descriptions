Student will analyze representations of scientific creativity in films and literature, conduct interviews with scientists, artists, musicians, and humanists, and analyze the social and institutional context of creativity. HON
4069 "HON 311" Words through Space and Time Cultures differentiate and frame events in various ways.  At the heart of conceptual events are WORDS: an inventory of the ways a particular group of people depict and understand the interactions they have with each other and with the world around them.  Through a detailed examination of lexical phenomena in cultures around the world, we will become familiar with the ways in which language and culture interact, the extent to which these surface in our everyday lives and the explanations proposed by various fields for their existence. HON
4070 "HON 312" Outbreak "Students will evaluate disease outbreaks from multiple different perspectives, including the biology of the infectious agent, clinical implications, and social/economic/political factors contributing to the spread of the disease or that were impacted by a major epidemic/pandemic. This course will be inquiry-guided. The instructor will not generally be ""presenting material"", but rather providing the structure in which students will be guided to investigate the issues from multiple perspectives through the use of case studies, primary and secondary literature, student-driven research and presentations, and concept mapping." HON
4071 "HON 313" Reading Machines "This course invites first-year students into a historically ranging, critically intensive, and hands-on learning environment about the technologies by which humans transmit our cultural inheritance and ideas. ""Reading Machines"" takes a long view of how we got to now, from the history of manuscripts and books to the electronic platforms of the digital present. These are all machines of reading; in turn, this class will ""read"" those machines as objects of study. The course proposes that 1) then and now, our technologies for sharing text, image, and data crucially shape the ideas which they convey, and 2) these contexts can help students plan and execute new mechanisms for communication in the present. The course's modules offer critical frameworks of background readings and discussions, a lab-like experience with the materials or skills involved, and applied projects for students to experiment with and study." HON
4072 "HON 314" Society's Mirror: Literature in 20th-Century America This course looks at several key works of twentieth-century American literature and asks what they reveal about the society in which they were produced. In honor of the beginning anew of the 20s, the first half of our class will consider the many ways literature in the Jazz Age represented and critiqued the era - from stories published in popular magazines, which find their modern-day equivalent in streaming services, to authors of the Harlem Renaissance. The second half of the class will take us to the second half of the century, where we will consider how authors like Ken Kesey, Shirley Jackson, and Margaret Atwood reveal and challenge prevailing conformity. To continue with our metaphor, the frame for our mirror will consist of the social, cultural, and material contexts in which these works were published, understood, and interpreted. HON
4073 "HON 340" Religion and Freedom "For a variety of reasons, ""religion"" is one of the most controversial subject matters in contemporary cultures. Beyond sensationalism and outrage, though, modern societies have taken shape in part through complex debates about the role (or lack thereof) of religion in public life. At the core of these considerations are clashing understandings of the relation between religion and freedom, two broad categories with a range of different meanings. This course will explore these differing understandings by considering: legal arguments proposing freedom of religion, and the challenges of religious pluralism; arguments urging freedom from religion, in defense of secular public life; and invocations of freedom through religion, via human creative expression, social activism, ritual, or cosmology. We will examine not just scholarly writings about religion but literature, films, and other media that have shaped the ongoing conversation." HON
4074 "HON 341" Time Travel A study of contemporary metaphysics organized around the topic of time travel.  David Lewis, perhaps the foremost contemporary metaphysician, argues that time travel is possible.  His argument is based on ingenious positions about three central topics of metaphysics, personal-identity, causation, and free will.  Students will consider each of these topics in some detail, always with an eye to their implications for time travel. HON
4075 "HON 344" Kantian Ethics In this course students will be introduced to foundations of morality by exploring one of the most significant moral theories in the history of philosophy, Kantian ethics.  The course will focus on Kant's ideas about morality and discuss his proof of the fundamental principles of ethics.  Students will be introduced to some of the enduring moral questions, such as What ought I to do?  What can I hope?  Are there universal moral principles and whether I ought to follow them?  They will learn a variety of approaches to ethical issues and their reflection in social and political reality. HON
4076 "HON 345" On the Human Students in this seminar course actively explore human singularity: the properties, if any, that distinguish persons from animals and machines.  Do we have souls?  To what extent can we give physical explanations of our thoughts and actions?  What, if anything, do scientific experiments tell us about our differences from chimps and artificial intelligences?  What are the ethical implications of new biotechnologies? Should we be allowed to use genetic and neural engineering to change human nature?  Students read articles, watch videos, stimulate class discussions with prepared questions, write short essays and a final paper, and participate in a 60-minute team presentation. HON
4077 "HON 347" Freedom and the Self This course explores the complex and interrelated concepts of freedom and the self. The bulk of our time will be devoted to a close reading of several philosophical texts in which these concepts loom large. The course ends with a careful examination of three novels that, in various ways, take up the central themes of the class. Our intention in doing so is to reflect on the way that imaginative novelists treat these themes. This will enable us to ask broader and more interesting questions about freedom and selfhood. HON
4078 "HON 348" Emotion and Reason Consider the range of emotions that one experiences in a lifetime, from the joy of being with your loved ones to the fear of losing them, from the thrill of success to the sadness of defeat. Pleasant or aversive, emotions play a central role in our lives. Despite their obvious importance, emotions have been considered by many philosophers to be inferior to another distinctive faculty in human beings, namely reason. The idea that emotions are primitive, irrational and dangerous and thus to be controlled and constrained by reason has been embraced by eminent thinkers from Plato and the Stoics to Kant. In this course, we will focus on the relationship between reason and emotion in moral cognition and cognition more generally, and we will investigate how/to what extent reason can be said to be distinct from and superior to emotion. HON
4079 "HON 352" Self, Schooling, and the Social Order: A Critical Examination What is the purpose of schooling?  What role does it play in producing particular types of citizens and social structures?  Theorists have imagined education as a space for democracy, as a way to cultivate identity, or as a method to train workers.  All of these imaginaries attempt to understand interrelationship between the self, schooling, and the social order.  This course will survey major social theories and, within the context of those theories, encounter texts which examine how schooling serves to maintain or subvert the social order. Course restricted to University Honors Program students; others by permission of the UHP. HON
4080 "HON 353" Code Breakers: Unlocking the Mysteries of One Human Language This course will introduce you to the architecture of one language.

You will learn how to elicit field data through direct questioning and gathering of texts, how to organize field data, how to prepare entries in a field dictionary, and how to organize and write grammar. Course restricted to University Honors Program students; others by permission of the UHP. HON
4081 "HON 354" The Winners and Losers of U.S. Agricultural Policy This course explores the history and unintended consequences of U.S. (and international) agricultural policy. We will develop tools to assess the logical, objective, and critical analysis of agricultural policies. Every policy intervention involves winners and losers and your objectives will be to identify and evaluate how welfare is affected by government intervention. Students will explain, hypothesize, or interpret a disciplinary issue, based on critically analyzed evidence. Current events will be emphasized and students will investigate how trade tensions between the U.S. and other countries often result in retaliation against U.S. agriculture. Grades will be based on student presentations, debates, class participation, and a final policy paper. HON
4082 "HON 355" Feelings of/from Technology: Analog Bodies in Digital Spaces While we live in a Digital Age, we have only begun to understand its full significance. What new possibilities arise in a virtualized future? Can we escape scarcity, this planet, even death? What problems might our technologies solve? Modern technologies also raise new existential challenges: Why has the increased prosperity that technologies provide been met with seemingly impoverished and unhappy lives, loneliness, and alienation? How does technology mediate our sense of identity and the relations we have with society, nature, and ourselves? This course will explore the phenomenology of technological life - that is, the descriptive study aimed at looking at the relations between humans and our world, a technologically-mediated world. We will use this experiential and descriptive approach to consider the moral dimensions and psychological and sociological consequences of digital and emerging technologies, especially information and communications technologies (ICTs) like the internet and social media. HON
4083 "HON 360" Music and Oppression Music and Oppression will examine how people use music both as a tool of oppression and a method of resisting oppression. Course topics will include the use of western classical music by colonial powers; music and torture; music during World War II (including the use of music in concentration camps and as propaganda in Allied and Axis countries); music in Indian Boarding Schools; music in the American Civil Rights Movement; and hip hop as the music of oppressed populations in Europe and the United States.
